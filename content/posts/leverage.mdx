**Leverage \= getting more for less.**

* Always apply your skillset in a more valuable environment.
* Always trade your skills in the highest-value markets.

#### Here’s the truth:

> Rich client \= fewer problems  
> Poor client \= more problems

> Rich company \= more valuable  
> Poor company \= less valuable

> Rich country \= more money  
> Poor country \= less money

**Why is working for a low-paying company not worth it?**.  
\- Because you can apply the same skillset in a more valuable environment.

**Why is working in a low-paying country not worth it?**.  
\- Because you can trade the same skills in higher-value markets.

Let’s say you can add 10% value to $1M — that's $1.1M.
Apply the same 10% value to $100M — that’s $110M, 100 times more impact.

You become more valuable simply by: <br />
  • Working for a high-paying company,<br />
  • Living in a high-paying country,   <br />
  • Solving high-paying problems. <br />

That’s how you multiply your value — without multiplying your effort.

Effort alone doesn’t scale.  
Leverage does.
